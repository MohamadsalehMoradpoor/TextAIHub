# Poetify Project

This repository contains the following files for the Poetify project, which generates poetry using artificial intelligence:

1. `PersianPoemCrawler.py`: This code is used for data crawling. It crawls and collects Persian poem data for further processing.

2. `PoeVerseKhayyam.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is used for generating poetry based on the poems of Khayyam. It utilizes the collected data from the PersianPoemCrawler to create poetic verses.

3. `PoeVerseKhayyamMoulavi.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is used for generating poetry based on the poems of Moulavi and Khayyam. It combines the data collected from PersianPoemCrawler and generates verses with a touch of both poets' styles.

Feel free to explore the code and use it for your own projects.
